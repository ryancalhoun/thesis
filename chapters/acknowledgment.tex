\section*{\centering Acknowledgments}
\hspace{15pt} I extend my greatest appreciation to my adviser, Dr. Jeffrey Uhlmann, for his constant support and
guidance. I thank him for his endless patience and dedication, without which this thesis could not have been realized.
He is the greatest mentor, teacher and friend, for which any student could ask. I also thank Dr. Simon Julier and Ottmar
Boschardt for their ideas and insight, which proved invaluable as this thesis progressed.

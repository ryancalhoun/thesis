Title: On the Relationship Between Generalized Covariance Union and the Minimal Enclosing Ellipsoid
Problem
\\
\\
\indent An important tool in the field of data fusion called Generalized Covariance Union (GCU) is used to combine
or merge probabilistic estimates or measurements, given in standard statistical notation. For easier
visualization during the course of research, it is common to represent the quantities involved using a set of
ellipsoids (in two dimensions, a set of ellipses). In the case of GCU, the results surprisingly appear
equivalent to finding a Minimal Enclosing Ellipsoid of Ellipsoids (MEEE), a problem from computational
geometry.
\\
\indent This thesis presents a means to analyze and test this described behavior numerically, detailing the one-
and two-dimensional cases, using mathematics which can be easily extended into higher dimensions. The
current hypothesis, supported by experimental evidence, is that the relationship between GCU and the
MEEE problem is one of equivalence.
\\
\indent Subsequent to this finding, pending a formal proof, it will be possible
to apply tools from computational geometry to solve data fusion problems.
